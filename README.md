**Variational Gaussian Process Approximation**

This project contains a python implementation of the basic VGPA algorithm for approximate inference in SDEs.
The code refers to the initial algorithms as published in:

* C. Archambeau, D. Cornford, M. Opper, J. Shawe-Taylor, _Gaussian process approximations of stochastic differential equations_,
in: Journal of Machine Learning Research, Workshop and Conference Proceedings. vol. 1, 2007, pp. 1â€“16.

The code can deal with both 1-D and N-D systems. Examples include:

0. Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (1-D)
0. Double-Well (1-D)
0. Lorenz-63 (3-D)
0. Lorenz-96 (40-D)

If someone is interested in applying the algorithm on other dynamical systems is fully responible to (re)-write the relevant
files for the necessary expectation functions.
